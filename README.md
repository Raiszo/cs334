# Udacity's Intro to parallel programming course

To be able to build cuda in win10:
+ Install Build Tools from visual studio 15.4.5(tested), coz no IDE's allowed :D
+ Install Cuda Toolkit 9.0(tested, people say 9.1 works too)
+ Use cmake and then msbuild, do not forget to set up PATH properly
+ Enjoy
